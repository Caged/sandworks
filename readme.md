Spine artwork.

### Installation
It doesn't appear pip can install from git urls via setup.py, and `--process-dependency-links` is
deprecated, so you have to install this package by hand.

```
git clone https://github.com/Caged/splineworks.git
cd splineworks
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install .
```
